- Whenever update library, change system design, significant update, remember write into README.md to keep latest overall description about project.

- Before implement a feature, remember read the README.md for first sign about architecture and structure to code, keep the code clean and readable for everyone.

- Always follow the monorepo structure: keep backend code in `apps/backend/` and frontend code in `apps/frontend/`. Never mix concerns between applications.

- When adding new dependencies, use `bun add` and ensure they're added to the correct workspace (use `-w` flag for workspace root, or run from the specific app directory).

- Maintain consistent code style: use TypeScript for type safety, follow existing patterns for file organization, and ensure proper error handling.

- Before making changes to shared configurations (nx.json, tsconfig.base.json, package.json at root), consider the impact on both frontend and backend applications.

- When adding new environment variables:
  - Backend: Add to `apps/backend/.env.example` with descriptive comments
  - Frontend: Add to `apps/frontend/.env.example` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix if needed in browser
  - Document all new variables in README.md under Environment Variables section

- Test changes locally before committing:
  - Run `bunx nx build <project>` to ensure builds succeed
  - Run `bunx nx lint <project>` to catch linting issues
  - Run `bunx nx test <project>` if tests exist
  - Test both applications together to verify integration

- Keep dependencies up to date but test thoroughly after updates. Document breaking changes in README.md.

- Follow security best practices:
  - Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` files
  - Keep sensitive keys and secrets in environment variables
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs
  - Use proper authentication and authorization checks

- When adding new API endpoints:
  - Document them in README.md under API Endpoints section
  - Include request/response examples
  - Implement proper error handling and validation
  - Update frontend API client if needed

- Maintain clear separation of concerns:
  - Backend: Business logic, data access, API endpoints
  - Frontend: UI components, client-side logic, user interactions
  - Shared types can go in a libs folder if needed

- Write meaningful commit messages that explain what changed and why.

- If adding new tools or development utilities (like LocatorJS), document their purpose, setup, and usage in README.md.
